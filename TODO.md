### TODO

Issues to fix:
1. Understand how passport is storing a record of a session and how that can be persisted outside server memory.
2. Implement the 'express-session' package to store sessions in MongoDB
3.


- Create login function on back-end
- How to handle session persistence?!?!?! Cookies I guess, but then those are stored in server memory
